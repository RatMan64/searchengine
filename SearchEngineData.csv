A high performance dream ride.Art by Kim Krans (@ kim_krans)  artist author and creator of The New York Times bestseller The Wild Unknown Tarot. “With ascension on our minds we came up with the idea to draw one of Travis’ longtime creature guardians (his animal spirit perhaps?) the Gyre Falcon on the Climax board. With ultra vision the Gyre comes to symbolize all the things the board aims to do – to carry the rider into a new paradigm where riding becomes a multidimensional experience and true freedom reigns.” ~Kim Krans  Key Features of Lib Tech T.Rice Climax Snowboard Core: 20% Aspen / 40% Paulownia / 40% BalsaGlass: Spread Toe Carbon / 33??

Arbor 25 Year Element Camber Wide Snowboard,Description: Arbor 25 Year Element Camber Wide Snowboard                        Arbor was launched in 1995 with a small collection of environmentally friendly snowboards. Each board was made with a sustainable Hawaiian Koa wood top and other alternative materials. Over the next 15 years Koa became our calling card anchoring the Brand’s vibe and our sustainability craftsmanship and performance message. The Koa was always secured by our founders who believe the best way to ensure something is sustainable is to know its source. The first Koa came from a forest restoration project on Maui where dead trees were removed by helicopter and sold to fund the effort. That work is done and the land was added to the Haleakala National Park where it will be forever protected. When we founded Arbor we also started our Returning Roots program which is dedicated to the preservation of Hawaii’s Koa Forests. In 2000 we stopped using Koa as sustainable sources became hard to find but we continued on with Returning Roots giving back to this critical natural and cultural treasure which is so closely tied to the roots of the surf skate snow way of life.To celebrate our 25th Anniversary we used the last two Koa logs sourced by Arbor’s co-founder Chris Jensen to create a limited edition Koa topped Element. The Element is our cornerstone Mountain-Twin. For 25 years it’s been the board we’ve built our line around. We’re proud to offer it one last time with Hawaiian Koa.

Arbor 25 Year Element Camber Snowboard,Description: Arbor 25 Year Element Camber Snowboard                        Arbor was launched in 1995 with a small collection of environmentally friendly snowboards. Each board was made with a sustainable Hawaiian Koa wood top and other alternative materials. Over the next 15 years Koa became our calling card anchoring the Brand’s vibe and our sustainability craftsmanship and performance message. The Koa was always secured by our founders who believe the best way to ensure something is sustainable is to know its source. The first Koa came from a forest restoration project on Maui where dead trees were removed by helicopter and sold to fund the effort. That work is done and the land was added to the Haleakala National Park where it will be forever protected. When we founded Arbor we also started our Returning Roots program which is dedicated to the preservation of Hawaii’s Koa Forests. In 2000 we stopped using Koa as sustainable sources became hard to find but we continued on with Returning Roots giving back to this critical natural and cultural treasure which is so closely tied to the roots of the surf skate snow way of life.To celebrate our 25th Anniversary we used the last two Koa logs sourced by Arbor’s co-founder Chris Jensen to create a limited edition Koa topped Element. The Element is our cornerstone Mountain-Twin. For 25 years it’s been the board we’ve built our line around. We’re proud to offer it one last time with Hawaiian Koa.
