Arbor 25 Year Element Camber Wide Snowboard,Description: Arbor 25 Year Element Camber Wide Snowboard                        Arbor was launched in 1995 with a small collection of environmentally friendly snowboards. Each board was made with a sustainable Hawaiian Koa wood top and other alternative materials. Over the next 15 years Koa became our calling card anchoring the Brand’s vibe and our sustainability craftsmanship and performance message. The Koa was always secured by our founders who believe the best way to ensure something is sustainable is to know its source. The first Koa came from a forest restoration project on Maui where dead trees were removed by helicopter and sold to fund the effort. That work is done and the land was added to the Haleakala National Park where it will be forever protected. When we founded Arbor we also started our Returning Roots program which is dedicated to the preservation of Hawaii’s Koa Forests. In 2000 we stopped using Koa as sustainable sources became hard to find but we continued on with Returning Roots giving back to this critical natural and cultural treasure which is so closely tied to the roots of the surf skate snow way of life.To celebrate our 25th Anniversary we used the last two Koa logs sourced by Arbor’s co-founder Chris Jensen to create a limited edition Koa topped Element. The Element is our cornerstone Mountain-Twin. For 25 years it’s been the board we’ve built our line around. We’re proud to offer it one last time with Hawaiian Koa.

Arbor 25 Year Element Camber Snowboard,Description: Arbor 25 Year Element Camber Snowboard                        Arbor was launched in 1995 with a small collection of environmentally friendly snowboards. Each board was made with a sustainable Hawaiian Koa wood top and other alternative materials. Over the next 15 years Koa became our calling card anchoring the Brand’s vibe and our sustainability craftsmanship and performance message. The Koa was always secured by our founders who believe the best way to ensure something is sustainable is to know its source. The first Koa came from a forest restoration project on Maui where dead trees were removed by helicopter and sold to fund the effort. That work is done and the land was added to the Haleakala National Park where it will be forever protected. When we founded Arbor we also started our Returning Roots program which is dedicated to the preservation of Hawaii’s Koa Forests. In 2000 we stopped using Koa as sustainable sources became hard to find but we continued on with Returning Roots giving back to this critical natural and cultural treasure which is so closely tied to the roots of the surf skate snow way of life.To celebrate our 25th Anniversary we used the last two Koa logs sourced by Arbor’s co-founder Chris Jensen to create a limited edition Koa topped Element. The Element is our cornerstone Mountain-Twin. For 25 years it’s been the board we’ve built our line around. We’re proud to offer it one last time with Hawaiian Koa.

Voile TelePro Avalanche Shovel,Description: Voile TelePro Avalanche Shovel                        The Voilé Telepro Avalanche Shovel is the closest thing we make to a snowplow. It’s made for moving mountains of snow and is the industry standard for ski patrollers mountain guides and rescue workers worldwide.The extended telescoping handle adds efficiency and reduces strain on your lower back. Once collapsed the handle removes easily from the scoop and stows conveniently in a pack for travel or making joyous turns downhill.But the accolades of the Telepro don’t stop there. First its large scoop is cold forged to its quintessential Voilé shape from 6061 aluminum. Then the scoop is heat-treated to an impressive T6 temper.T6-tempered 6061 aluminum has an ultimate tensile strength of 42000 psi and yield strength of 35000 psi. So what does all that mean? Let’s just say the end result is a scoop that rivals the strength and rigidity of a heavy steel scoop you might find on a transfer shovel from a hardware store.The shovel scoop of the Telepro Avalanche Shovel features a pair of slotted holes. In the deft hands of a snow expert these “deadman” holes may used to fashion an emergency rescue sled or snow anchor. (Please don’t rap off the latter into a deep crevasse.)The Telepro is truly a professional-level avalanche shovel at a price that anybody can dig.

Voile Revelator BC Splitboard,Description: Voile Revelator BC Splitboard                        Becoming the industry leader in the backcountry splitboard category didn’t happen by accident. Or with narrow-minded thinking. Or by not taking inspiration from anywhere. So when the malcontents at Voilé pondered a little augmentation for their kick-ass Revelator somehow a flashback to wool plaid shirts three-pin leather boots and goofy nylon gaiters came to mind. And the Voilé Revelator BC was born. Thanks to its “Voile Traction-Pattern Base” the Revelator BC lets backcountry snowboarders ride up and down moderate rolling terrain without the bother of applying climbing skins. This feature can be a real boon on tours with long approaches or occasional pitches of steep – but very short – climbing. All that said the “fish-scaled” base is not a substitute for carrying climbing skins so please don’t leave home without them. The versatility of the Revelator BC does not however compromise any of the great build features of the “normal” Revelator. And as always Voilé predictably wraps up their wacked-out innovation in a very-lightweight package.

Voile TelePro Avalanche Shovel,Description: Voile TelePro Avalanche Shovel                        The Voilé Telepro Avalanche Shovel is the closest thing we make to a snowplow. It’s made for moving mountains of snow and is the industry standard for ski patrollers mountain guides and rescue workers worldwide.The extended telescoping handle adds efficiency and reduces strain on your lower back. Once collapsed the handle removes easily from the scoop and stows conveniently in a pack for travel or making joyous turns downhill.But the accolades of the Telepro don’t stop there. First its large scoop is cold forged to its quintessential Voilé shape from 6061 aluminum. Then the scoop is heat-treated to an impressive T6 temper.T6-tempered 6061 aluminum has an ultimate tensile strength of 42000 psi and yield strength of 35000 psi. So what does all that mean? Let’s just say the end result is a scoop that rivals the strength and rigidity of a heavy steel scoop you might find on a transfer shovel from a hardware store.The shovel scoop of the Telepro Avalanche Shovel features a pair of slotted holes. In the deft hands of a snow expert these “deadman” holes may used to fashion an emergency rescue sled or snow anchor. (Please don’t rap off the latter into a deep crevasse.)The Telepro is truly a professional-level avalanche shovel at a price that anybody can dig.

Voile TelePack Avalanche Shovel,Description: Voile TelePack Avalanche Shovel                        For times when a snow professional is less concerned with moving snow for routine chores or not specifically recruited for a rescue operation the Voilé Telepack Avalanche Shovel is an excellent alternative to our Telepro shovel.Fitted with the same bomber scoop as the Telepro the Telepack features a slightly-shorter T-handle (rather than a D-grip) for compact stowage inside a pack. Otherwise the shovel performs equally well as the Telepro and also features the same pair of deadman holes for rigging an emergency sled or snow fluke.Once again the 6061-T6 aluminum used in the Telepack scoop really shines in challenging snow and debris. T6 is the level of hardness reached in the aluminum heat-treating process resulting in a metal that rivals steel for strength and rigidity at a fraction of the weight.The Voilé Telepack Avalanch Shovel: A great choice for pros on the move or any backcountry enthusiast who wants peace of mind.
